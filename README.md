# DroneOn
An app intended to let the user play drones on their iPhone or iPad.

Created in objective-c for ease of use with the libpd/pd-for-ios.

Goals of the final app:
* play back sine tones and filtered noise
* create drones using basic FM synthesis 
* allow user to record and loop their own drones 
 
This app is mainly intended to be useful to musicians as a practice tool.

For ease of cloning and including submodules use `git clone --recursive`
